				Motivation, Insights, and
				Information Gained from the Career
				Talk Being passionate and proactive in
				acquiring both technical and soft skills
				—such as engaging in self-learning
				beyond formal university lectures—
				plays a vital role in personal growth and
				skill development. 
			   Taking the initiative and demonstrating
				a willingness to grow are key attributes
				for success in the job market.
				Choosing a role that matches one’s
				strengths and passions is critical to
				maintaining motivation and contributing
				positively to a company’s success.
				Strong relationships among colleagues
				foster a positive work environment
				where individuals from diverse
				backgrounds willingly share ideas,
				support one another, and collaborate to
				overcome challenges.
				Identifying and reaching out to the
				right people—whether they are senior
				colleagues or mentors—can provide
				guidance, facilitate problem-solving,
				and enhance career growth.
				This career talk inspired us to focus on
				three key areas: continuous learning,
				deep interest, effective communication,
				and meaningful relationship-building.

            <h2>Reflection 2: Design Thinking</h2>
            <p>
				<strong>1. Initial Goal and Inspiration</strong>
<p>
    Our primary goal is to empower individuals with physical disabilities by providing a 
    convenient solution for performing therapy exercises anytime, anywhere. By doing so, we aim 
    to ease their recovery journey and enhance their quality of life. Drawing from the knowledge 
    gained in our Technology and Information Systems Course, we have implemented innovative 
    technological principles to design and develop a user-friendly software application. This app 
    not only incorporates our academic learnings but also demonstrates our ability to apply 
    theoretical knowledge to real-world challenges, combining empathy, creativity, and 
    functionality in one cohesive solution.
</p>

<strong>2. Design Thinking and Its Impact</strong>
<p>
    Throughout the design thinking process, we adopted the five essential steps—
    <strong>Empathy, Define, Ideate, Prototype,</strong> and <strong>Test</strong>—to thoroughly analyse the problem, 
    generate creative solutions, and refine our app based on user feedback.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>a) Empathy:</strong> We immersed ourselves in understanding the struggles and needs of 
        individuals undergoing physical therapy. This user-centric approach allowed us to 
        design solutions that address real challenges.
    </li>
    <li><strong>b) Define:</strong> We clearly articulated the core problem: the lack of an accessible, personalized, 
        and technology-driven therapy tool for individuals with diverse needs.
    </li>
    <li><strong>c) Ideate:</strong> Through brainstorming and role-storming sessions, we explored innovative 
        ideas and features, such as AI-driven exercise guidance,progress tracking, and 
        personalized tutorials.
    </li>
    <li><strong>d) Prototype:</strong> We created a functional prototype that showcases our vision, ensuring the 
        design is intuitive and user-friendly.
    </li>
    <li><strong>e) Test:</strong> By gathering feedback from potential users and stakeholders, we identified areas 
        for improvement and refined the app to better align with user expectations.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This iterative process has not only brought us closer to achieving our goal of creating a 
    transformative therapy app but has also equipped us with skills in problem-solving, 
    collaboration, and innovation.
</p>

<strong>3. Future Action for Potential Improvement</strong>
<p>
    To ensure the continued growth and success of our app, we will be continuously refining our 
    app and expanding our skillset such as embracing cutting-edge technology, expanding 
    accessibility, and collaborating with experts. By doing so, we get to position ourselves to make 
    significant contributions to the healthcare technology industry. Our project not only showcases 
    our ability to innovate but also reflects our commitment to creating technology solutions that 
    are both impactful and inclusive. This journey has solidified our vision of becoming leaders in 
   digital healthcare, where we can bridge the gap between technology and personalized therapy 
    to improve lives.

            <p>
				To ensure success in my Computer Science degree over the next four years, I will focus on building a strong foundation in programming, as emphasized by Mr. Hakimi. 
				Acquiring proficiency in multiple programming languages, such as Python, Java, and C++, will help me develop solid problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of logic and algorithms. Additionally, Mr. Nik’s advice on creating a strong CV and utilizing the right tools for different computing positions is crucial. I will work on enhancing my resume with relevant projects and skills, while familiarizing myself with industry-standard tools and platforms for roles like system analyst, developer, or data scientist.
				By aligning my academic learning with industry expectations, continuously improving my technical abilities, and preparing strategically for future opportunities, I can navigate my degree and career trajectory with confidence.
